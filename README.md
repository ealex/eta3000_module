# eta3000_module
2S balancer module based on the ETA3000 inductive balancer IC

This uses the SOT23-6 chip and it's designed for the smallest footprint possible.
The ballancing curent is intended to be low, for heat dissipation reasons.
The modules are intented to be conected toghether for more than 2S packs.

TODO: update README when the PCB's are here
